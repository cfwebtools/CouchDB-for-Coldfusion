To use this example:1. Create a database in CouchDB2. Edit application.database_params in onApplicationStart() (within Application.cfc) to match your database and CouchDB settings.3. Add some posts using the adminNOTES: - This example will not work if you have ever added a user to CouchDB. I don't know why this happens yet!- If you start this app before creating the database, it will not work until you call /index.cfm?reload=1 or the app "times out".Enjoy!-Russ
